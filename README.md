## building

- gather and install dependencies
  - getting kindle device jars
    - https://github.com/aerickson/kindle-jar-extractor
    - with ssh via usbnetwork hack (see above for directories to copy and destination path).
  - install ant
    - OS X
      - `brew install ant`
    - linux/debian
      - `apt install ant`
  - install kindletool
    - https://github.com/NiLuJe/KindleTool
  - install Java 1.4-1.8
    - Because the Kindle devices use an older version of Java, we need older JDKs that can produce bytecode that's compatible. See https://openjdk.java.net/jeps/182 for details.
      - OpenJDK 8 does work.
      - Oracle Java 10 does not work.
